# Simple example of a while-statement.
# Do something as long as a condition evaluates to True:

i = 0
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    # i = i + 1 # or shorthand notation: i += 1
print ('Variable i is now 10. The loop has ended')

# We have a infinte loop on purpose. It
# stops if we enter 'quit' on the command line
# print('Please enter some text, or type "quit" to quit:')
# while True:
#     response = input()
#     print('You entered : ' + response)
#     if (response.lower() == 'quit'):
#         break






# ************
# Workshop result - but first tryit  yourself!
# ************
# Add all numbers together, stop if 0 is entered
# print('Enter numbers. Type 0 if you want to stop.')
# total = 0
# while True:
#     number = input()
#     total += int(number)
#     if(int(number) == 0):
#         break
# print('The total of these numbers is: ' + str(total))
