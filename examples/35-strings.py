# strings.py - some examples on strings

# 1. These are all valid
string1 = 'I am a string'
string2 = "I am also a string"
stringNested = "Martin Luther King said: 'I have a dream!'"

# 2. You can't be inconsistent. So next line is INVALID
# stringInvalid = "I have single and double quotes combined'

# 3. String concatenation. Just place them adjacent to each other:
# print ('Hello ' 'World') # Hello World
# h = 'Hello'
# w = 'world'
# print (h, w) # Hello world

# 4. multiline strings - use 3 double quotes
# multiline = """
#     Shall I compare thee to a summers day?
#     Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
#     Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
#     And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
# """
# print (multiline)

# 5. Backslash in strings
# backslash = 'this is a backslash \\ in a string'
# print (backslash)

# 6. Raw strings, use letter 'r'
# rawString = r'C:\Users\Peter\Documents\HelloWorld.py'
# print(rawString)

# 7. Sequential strings. Using index notation
# hello = 'Hello World'
# print(hello[0])  # 'H'
# print(hello[6])  # 'W'
